rodney sg,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2022","I am relatively new to the videography game,  ut I was able to level up with this lens on my GH6 using the viltrox speed booster. So glad I made this purchase, this does it all for me in run and gun, as well as corporate content, I can’t regret this purchase, even with my lack of experience this lens hits all the right spots"
JT Andrews,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2022","This lens is awesome! For the price you get with the shallow depth of field, the ability to do portrait photos and landscapes. It also doubles as being an insane cinema-ish lens for aspiring or seasoned filmmakers. The shallow depth of field combines with the sharpness of the lens makes this lens an amazing product"
"DIX PIX photo, video, and pro audio",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2016","There's NO WAY there's a better video lens for the a6300 (if it is appropriate to use, meaning for being close up, or for wanting to be wide)."
danno,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2022","I have a love hate relationship with lenses.  Most of the ones I have bought are great for daytime use.  But since I do astrophotography and my lenses are always dual use, most of the lenses I have bought are not great for Astro."
maskirovka,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2013","This is a review I expect to update as I continue to use my brand new Sigma 18-35mm F1.8 lens.  I am not a super-technical pixel-peeper kind of guy but I am a pretty experienced photographer and I'm writing this with a similar audience in mind.  I bought this lens because I do a lot of event photography, especially dance (doing volunteer work for a ballet company) and while I've done pretty well with my trusty Canon 24-70mm F2.8 lens, I've felt a bit (sometimes more than a bit) limited when I photograph fast moving dance sequences in the low-light environments stage and dance very often are.  That's because the 24-70mm F2.8 simply doesn't do as well on an EOS 7D with its 1.6x (APS-C) crop that it does on a full-frame like my EOS 5D Mark III."
Larry Flaxman,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2022","This is an excellent lens for anyone looking to get into photography. The image quality is superb and the autofocus is very fast and accurate. The build quality is also excellent, feeling very solid and well-constructed. The only downside is that it is a bit on the heavy side, but that is to be expected with a lens of this caliber. The biggest negative (for me at least) is that it's SUPER LARGE... AND HEAVY! Overall, I would highly recommend it to anyone in the market for a new lens - as long as you are ok with the size."
Kingsmen Media Group,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2022",Great lens but a lil expensive
MicahO,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2015",This is my new everything lens. I've got a 70D that I've been using on an off for a year. Recently I just lost my job and began picking up freelance work and I needed a much faster lens for the new work I was doing. I bought this baby and I love it. I'm able to get very good indoor low light shots and still keep a substantial amount of bokeh. It's got a great build quality and wonderful feel. I still haven't gotten used to the lens zoom which is opposite of Canon lenses but its a small problem I'm sure I'll soon adjust to.
Erica manzano,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2022","What an amazing lens! If you’re still on the fence of getting it, let this be your sign. I never leave reviews but this item was to good to not brag about."

Ernesto García,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2016","I'm an amateur photographer, and as such, I appreciate the versatility that this lens gives me. First, the wide aperture at a wide angle, something that is hard to find even on primes, and second, the fact that is not a prime lens and allows you a certain degree on zooming, albeit not much. but who would ask for more of this."
Jesse,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2022",Very nice lens.  I’m super happy with my purchase.  It is quite heavy but is built incredibly well.
Gama,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2022","I love everything about this lens. Unfortunately my lens came with a defect. As I was inspecting it, I noticed that it had to dust particles inside the lens. Those particles are impossible to clean. I’m going to have to return it but I will purchase another one from Amazon instead of a third-party."
Doug Davis,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2017","I recently got my Panasonic GH4 and was told this was the go to lens for most shooters with this camera. I did my research and found out this lens becomes a 1.2 with the metabones adapter.. I had to try it out. I purchased this used right here from amazon for a few hundred dollars cheaper and I couldn't tell that the lens wasn't brand new.. It came with not a single mark on it and worked as If nobody ever used it. I'm assuming someone returned it once they found out it was a cropped sensor and wouldn't work properly on a Full Frame Camera. Luckily for me, the GH4 isn't full framed and it worked and looks amazing."
Maruwaan,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2018",The Pros:
Zachary J. Millimet,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2014","I did a painstaking amount of research prior to purchasing this lens back in December 2013.  IAt the time, I was looking to upgrade from the mediocre kit lens that came with my Canon T3i and I went back and forth between this lens, a litany of Canon L lenses, as well as considering just buying 2 separate prime lenses.  At the end of the day, I don't think I could have gone wrong with any of my choices.  It's hard to go wrong with high end Primes and Canon's L series lenses at the lower focal lengths are fantastic.  So why did I buy the Sigma.  Certainly, the reviews from professionals were all stellar.  This gave me peace of mind  Second, I spent a lot of time considering how I like to shoot.  I really dislike using flash, bur rather prefer fast lenses with low F-stops to allow me to shoot indoors and in low light situations without flash, when possible.  So the fact that this lens allows F/1.8 was a big selling feature.  The fact that it was fixed across all the focal lengths really started to sell me.  Lastly, this lens covers a small, but critical zoom range:  18-35mm.  Especially because I shoot on a cropped body camera, this is the range I mostly live in all the time when shooting.  This lens is perfect - functing like a prime, across a critical focal range.  Some people have noted that it can be a bit soft on autofocus or mis-focus when using certain camera bodies.  I choice my focal points very specifically, and this has not been an issues for me.  The bokeh is very good, some lenses are better, but still this lens produces great bokeh.  It is also a very large and heavy lens - there is a lot of glass here.  Any prospective buyer should be aware of this.  For me, I have come to appreciate this heft of the lens - it is part of what I love about this lens."
me,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2016","I have had this lens for 6 months now and feel I can give a useful review. The first thing is this is a large and heavy lens. I carried it on a k3ii at the state fair for a full day and was always aware that it was there. This is not a lens that I can ""forget"" is there. Only my 60-250 f4 is larger and heavier. One thing that helps though is that it does not extend when zoomed. Some have complained that the lens cap is difficult to put on and does not stay on well; I find it takes a little more attention when installing but is not that difficult and stays on as well as any other I have. The lens shade is a nice small diameter, unlike the monster on the 12-24 f4, which makes it nicer when in the backpack and not on the camera. Focus is a real issue with this lens and many have given up on it for that reason, though some seem to get a reasonably good one out of the box. Mine was OK at all focal lengths except 35mm which I fixed with a -5 setting at that length with the dock. Now it focuses as well as any lens I have. Sharpness is very good but at 35mm my FA 35 f2 is just as sharp except wide open. I have used this lens indoors without a flash but you must remember that at large f-stops the depth of field is VERY shallow and focus must be spot on to get sharp results. Focus is fast and quiet and it does not hunt. There is some flair under certain conditions but this must be expected with 17 lens elements and so much glass.The build quality is equal to any Pentax lens I have. With the limited zoom range and size and weight that cannot be ignored I consider this lens somewhat of a niche lens; too limited to be a do all walk around lens but uniquely useful for certain applications and I am very glad to own it."
Steven Thistle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2016","Recently bought this Sigma 18-35 F1.8 Art lens (Canon Mount) for my Lumix GH4 and connecting the two with my Metabones Speed Booster. I film a lot of weddings here in Cape Town, South Africa and I needed a lens that was good for ""run and gun"" shooting. After testing it out quite a bit and shooting a wedding with it, I was pleasantly surprised with just how sharp this lens is! Like.. WOW! I've been a big believer for a long time that zoom lenses just aren't the way to go, because you just don't get the image quality or the sharpness that you do with a prime lens. But this lens might be sharper than some primes that I've been using for a few years now!"
Lee O.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2015","Before purchasing this lens, I decided to rent it for a couple of days and see how well it performed.  I used it to take photos for a local late night talk show and it left me very impressed."
Marianne Bischoff,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2021","I purchased this lens spontaneously in January and I have to say, this is the best lens I’ve ever purchased. I was nervous because this was the most expensive lens that I ever bought but it has now become my go to lens over my nifty fifty, ANY DAY. Catch me snapping sunsets, ocean views or taking portraits with this baby. She is perfect. The bit of a wide angle makes it so ideal for any landscapes and any kind of portraits, especially big family shots. Im a manual gal but I do really appreciate the autofocus on this, especially when I photograph the toddlers at my job who are always on the go. You won’t have a single ounce of regret purchasing this, it’s worth every penny. In fact, I just purchased another Sigma that’s coming in the mail today!"
Engedalians,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2019","Everything you've read about this lens is true.  Most would call the end result ""dreamy"".  I would call it sensuous.  You can almost feel the captured scene.  This lens is truly amazing, even more so that it's reasonably priced."
dfw1417,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2013",This Sigma 18-35mm F1.8 lens is super! I was reluctant to spend this much on a lens. The last zoom lens I purchased was Sigma 28-300mm f3.5-f5.6 for my Canon T2i and it has not been off the camera since I bought it over 3 years ago! Now that I got the Canon T5i I wanted a lens with great low light capability and all of Canon's was over $1000 each!
Jason Garman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 9, 2016","This lens is astoundingly sharp! I'm using this with a Canon T6i and the resulting picture quality is nothing short of amazing. That said, you will most likely encounter focusing issues when shooting wide open. Then, why a 5 star review? As other reviewers have mentioned, don't buy this lens unless you also get the corresponding SIGMA USB dock for your camera mount."
Lokiparts,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2019","I love, love, love this lens. I am far from being a professional photographer, or videographer, but I would easily consider myself an advanced amateur. For a long time I have been making due with an old 50mm lens as my only real fast lens along with a hand full of slow entry-level zooms and pancake primes. I had been dying to get a fast wide prime, but I was having a hard time picking the perfect focal length. So when I found this lens and started researching it, it almost sounded too good to be true."
BS!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2020","This is indeed a sharp lens. It is bulky (much larger than one would think). The colors are neutral and the images are hard to fault. Very good for indoor and outdoor shooting. Construction is sturdy even though it has lots of plastic parts. I didn't notice any bothersome distortions. For Sony cameras, it's actually a very good choice because it doesn't have any major color casts and is even on the less saturated side, so it minimizes various color casts inherent in Sony rendering when white balance isn't calibrated to a strict 6500K daylight setting."
Evie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2018","I would like to begin with stating that I am not a professional, there is so much that I still have to learn about photography. However, I decided to take a leap and make this purchase. First, I received the item three days sooner than expected and that made me super happy. I was impressed with the quick arrival of the product. Second, upon opening up the package and pulling out the lens I was impressed by the weight of it and the feel of it. Again I'd like to state that I am not a professional, however the item did not feel cheap by any means. It has a very solid feel. I's a complete amateur  but I love, love, the effect that this specific lens give. I did only receive the lens and played with it for about an hour but still I am super excited to see what this thing can do, OH! yeah one thing that is noticeable is the AF feature, you can hear the lens trying to focus but the lens is pretty awesome I can live with it. Anyway, I will be updating my post after a couple months of use. Anyway hope that helps from an amateurs  perspective."

TECHFIT360,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2015","Where do i begin? Before i began making youtube videos i would always hear nothing but great things about the Sigma 18-35mm F1.8. Well i recently purchased this for myself and all i can say is OMG! This lens is incredible i mean where else can you find a zoom lens that has a 1.8 F-stop. This lens lets an insane amount of light in so i can keep my iso setting pretty low when shooting inside. My video quality has left the back of the line and straight to the front. I'm talking ""Team Crispy"" You see up to this point i had been using my 18-55mm Kit lens. So i was blown away by the quality of this lens and how heavy and well made it is. The zoom ring is amazing, i get nice fluid zoom action with the Lens. I am a very happy customer and you will be too. It comes with it's own hood and a very attractive carrying bag for the lens. If i could give this 10 stars i would. The only negative thing i can say is that sometimes the focusing can be a pain, but i am very satisfied with my purchase. So to those out there who want to take their photography and videography to the next level, then this lens is for you! I hope this review helps you with your purchasing decision."
Darth Rob,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2013","The image quality is exceptional and the lens is sharp even wide open. There's some blue fringing but nothing that can't be easily fixed in RAW processing, but I am just nitpicking now. The build is exceptional - the zoom and focus rings are buttery smooth and nothing like I've experienced yet. It's smoother than some L series I've handled. The HSM is super quiet and completely inaudible in normal noise level environment. One of the things that I was really impressed with was that this lens ships with its own case and hood. Even the case is well made and appears better than the case Canon ships with the L series. Canon stands to learn a lot on that front alone - it's ridiculous that Canon doesn't ship hoods with Non- L series lenses and charges an additional $50-100 depending on the lens for the hood."
Joshua A. Dunlap,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2021",An amazing lens that immediately made 80% of my lens collection irrelevant. The lens stays at a wide aperture of 1.8 from 18-35mm and the images are super sharp. I highly recommend it. I wish I would have bought this sooner!
Charles Le Pere,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2020","I bought this primarily for video work with my BMPCC6K.  It is a spectacularly sharp lens.  The build quality is superb.  I also have the Canon 17-55mm F/2.8 EF-S (not full frame lens).  I definitely like the wider aperture of the sigma more and the fact that the sigma does not telescope through its zoom range, unlike the canon.  But canon’s zoom range is greater and it has optical image stabilization, which I am miss greatly on the sigma.  So I end up using the sigma for shoots with people using a tripod or stabilizer and the canon for landscape work typically."
G.R.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2021","This order was “fulfilled by Amazon”. Lens/lens box and contents were placed inside a brown Amazon shipping box, w/no bubble wrap, etc., and shipped from Kentucky to Alaska via USPS. Thanks Amazon. Very kind of you."
Julia,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2021","I LOOOVE this lens so much! Been wanting this for so long and finally my hubby gifted it to me for Christmas😀 I have a beauty YouTube channel, and I’ve been wanting to get that blurred background as others YouTube’s have, and I got it! Highly recommend this lens if you want to improve your video quality, trust me, your viewers will appreciate that 🔥🔥 This lens is pretty heavy, like HEAVYY:) Took me sometime to get used to that, as well as I had to use a more sturdy stand holder for my Canon M50, but that’s okay☺️ Thanks Sigma for creating such beauty ❤️❤️"
Ian,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2014","I needed to upgrade my wide zoom range as I have a big gap between 16mm and 70mm.  I was using an old MF Vivitar 28-50mm as my primary lens in this range, so my love for the Sigma lens might be extremely skewed, but the Art lens is gorgeous.  The sharpness throughout the f stops is excellent where it is supposed to be, and very good where other lenses would show their weaknesses.  Whenever I scroll through my Lightroom catalog without any picture information turned on, it is immediately apparent which pictures were made with the Sigma."
Joshua,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2020","Desde hace mas de veinte años me dedico a la fotografía. He aprendido que en vez de invertir en cámaras hay que invertir en lentes. Pero los mejores lentes son muy costosos. Decidí vender tres de mis lentes. Nikon 35 mm 1.8 G; Nikon 50 mm 1.8 D y mi sigma 18-50 2.8. Y coloqué la diferencia. No me arrepiento. La calidad de lente es superior(algo pesado), trabaja en cualquier condición de luz y mi Nikon D7500 trabaja superbien. Cuando lo compré temí algún defecto de micro ajuste de enfoque. Pero este lente no tuvo ningún problema. De forma preventiva compré el dock. Repito la calidad de las imágenes es superior y disfruto aun mas haciendo mis trabajos de fotografía."
DDuck4Life,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2014",Fantastic lens. super sharp and has the potential to be my walk around lens. Great for anyone looking to shoot in low light situations and don't want to worry about have the correct prime lens for the situation. If you can find it in stock.
Riducharme12,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2020","As someone who is just beginning to really get into film, I heard a lot of talk about this lens. I thought maybe, like most things on the internet including reviews, that it might be overhyped. I splurged though and was not disappointed. This lens is fantastic. It does everything you want and gives your film that medium/close up shot that really pops. No need to worry about if your kit glass (the lenses that most people buy with the camera) have enough depth of field to really convey what the subject is, this lens clearly emphasis it  + so much bokeh! A great overall lens for film. Would recommend to anyone who wants to start to make their shots look cinematic and beautiful."
e39'r,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2016","I bought this lens as the final leg of an awesome trifecta... Panny GH4, Metabones Speed Booster and yep... SIGMA 18-35 F1.8. This is an awesome combination and it's done everything I've asked of it thus far. Just for the heck of it I put the SIGMA on my T3i to see how it compared to my Canon 17-55 2.8 EFS. I didn't do the kind of testing you see some folks do on YouTube, etc. but there seemed to be considerably less chromatic aberration around edges as compared to the Canon. I primarily shoot video and if the SIGMA had OIS I probably would have given it five stars. Be warned, it IS heavy and I do miss the range compared to the Canon but the image quality is superior. Like most photo and video equipment, whether or not this lens is for you depends on how you plan on using it. I see a lot of folks complaining about focus issues but as a videographer I just about never use autofocus and because the GH4 has focus peaking I never have a problem getting the shot."

DJ,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2019",Unheard of 1.8 zoom. Using with Sony a6600 which has IBIS. Would be nice if the lens had IS too. Len's AF not as fast as a6600's AF so it's a compromise in keeping up.
Kamelle Jaye,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2019",This is my second favourite lens to use overall and my favourite lens to use for landscapes. I own a Canon 80D and I love how sharp my photos look. I'm not too technical when it comes to lens specs but as a casual photographer I usually have this and my 24-70 in my bag. I tried using it for portraits and I kept it at the 35mm focal length. (For me 18mm is a bit too wide for APS-C. I think its a 28mm Full Frame equivalent).
Michelle A.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2021",Fits the EVA1 and a good balance of primes and a zoom with the t/1.8.
Mindcontrol,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2014","I originally reviewed this lens when it first came out around 5 years ago. It's IQ and quality build is second to none. There is review after review online about how good this lens is. It's interesting that I feel limited on a cropped sensor body when I use a 35mm prime, however, when I have this 18-35 I tend to want more zoom. Canon has the 17-40 f/4 that offers 5mm greater zoom however that lens is no where near as good as this lens. I don't even consider them in the same category. There is one major drawback; not enough to reduce a star, but that is the size and weight of this lens. I took some excellent low light fish photos at the Monterey Bay Aquarium with this lens. I was there for approx 4 hours and it did not weigh too heavy on me. Anything longer than 4 hours might begin to takes it's toll if you are not used to carrying around a heavy lens. Overall I don't think there is another lens like this around. It's in a class of it's own. You can replace a few primes (24 and 35mm) for this lens. I enthusiastically recommend this lens."
Randy W. Dietmeyer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2016",Without a doubt the sharpest lens I now own for my 7D Mark II.  Putting this on actually made me feel like I upgraded the camera body itself!  I just wish it had a wider zoom range and I am still swapping it for my 24-105 L.
Rider for Life,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2021","This is my go to indoor lens.  f1.8 is nuts and perfect for letting light in!  My D80 loves the solid image quality.  I also use it for double duty when taking landscapes.  With this 18-35, a Sigma 24-70, and a Canon 70-300mm DOI feel set.  Oh, also a 50mm f1.8 rounds out my limited selection of lenses!"
Michael,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2017","I've been using this lens with my Nikon D7100 for over three years and I use it 95% of the time as I shoot mostly landscapes and it works well for portraits too at 30-35mm.  This lens brings my Nikon crop sensor camera pretty close to full-frame quality.  The only problem I have with using a non-Nikon lens is there's no in-camera auto correction for lens distortion, so I would have to buy Adobe Lightroom to correct for the distortion.  I find Nikon's View NX2 software is excellent at post processing my RAW images so I really don't want to buy Lightroom just to fix the lens distortion.  And if I do buy Lightroom I'll have to redo all my old RAW files that I've already processed with View NX2.  But if you already have Lightroom then there's no reason not to get this lens as it's as good as it gets at a price that's a relative bargain."
Jen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2021",Amazing for portrait photography. Takes your photography from nice to AMAZING! Depth of field amazing. Totally worth the price. Pays for itself 🙌🏼
An Honest Reviewer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2017","Pretty amazing lens. It's fast, so great for indoor photography when little to no lighting equipment is available. However, it's focus is not always accurate. That, coupled with it's lack of image stabilization are huge drawbacks. Nevertheless, it is still the best 'pro' lens available for an Canon APS-C body that I know of."
KieuLy Nguyen,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2019","I've been using this for 3 months now. The photos are incredibly sharp. I have to say however that this lens doesn't have image stabilization but I knew it when I bought the item. That's easily fixable with a rig. What I do find as a small pet peeve is that the lens is slow to auto-focus and makes sound that is clearly audible when I take videos. It's a small fault in the lens and, for the price, I think this is the greatest aperture and length for those starting out in film making and want an all-rounder."
Kevin,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2021","Shipping packaging was lacking, lense appears to be ok, hood was broken and went thru Sigma direct to get a replacement. Not going thru this supplier in the future, others rave. Pay a tad more and get locally in your camera shop. Not saving anything here, costs you."
curious,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2013",I was very excited when I was informed that the lens was available and I would get it in a few days. This excitement quickly turned into disappointment after taking a few shots with this lens.
W. Dyer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2018","A very sharp lens, with a very fast and usable large aperture, f 1.8. It is sharp at f1.8 and just gets sharper until f8 when diffraction begins to set in. It is still very usable at f16 for greater depth of field.  It is sharp across the field of view, center to corner. It has the focal length equivalent on a full frame camera of 27mm to 52mm.  Not a huge range, but a useful one.  It is reported to be sharpest at 18mm but it is sharp at all focal lengths. It is a somewhat heavy lens, but very well built.  It does not have vibration reduction.  But it is very hand holdable in the 1/25 of a second to 1/100th of a second depending on focal length.  Higher shutter speeds are of course better. Highly recommended for Nikon and Canon crop sensor cameras."
Alex Le,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2021","The Sigma 18-35mm f1.8 is a pretty incredible lens. Especially since it opens to f1.8, giving that dreamy bokeh and the low light is pretty phenomenal. Autofocus is consistently fast and works well."
AG,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2016",I bought this lens a few days ago and I am very impressed! This thing is razor sharp and fast! I do some event photography and I was looking for something bright and wide. The constant 1.8 aperture is great for low light situations like indoor photography. I will also be using this lens as my travel lens since it has a wide view.

FastK5,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2015",The sigma 18-35mm is both sharp and frustrating to use. The autofocus is not reliable. But after making adjustments with the USB dock I could get it working well except when shooting objects at infinity with the focal length set to 35mm. I use the Pentax k3 which has a fine adjustment for autofocus. I have managed to more or less get it working at all focal lengths except 35mm (when the object is very far away).
Tommy D,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2020","This lens turned out to be heavier than I thought it would be, but definitely not problematic.  I like the solid feel it has on the Nikon D500, and even on an older D7100.  One of the reasons I went with all Sigma lenses was because of problems with auto-focus.  Sigma gives me the option (with the USB dock) of adjusting any back or front focusing issues.  I prefer this over trying to go through the incomplete effort of changing the focus issues in the camera."
DJ Savage,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2019","This lens is amazing and probably the best lens you will ever have, but it is only for cinematography.  It is a Super clear lens  Great for cinema but this is not a lens made for photography. The only thing I did not like about this lens is that it is a bit heavy but maybe that is the reason it is such a great lens, so I can live with that. You will have to add pull focus/zoom gears to this lens, not a deal breaker. If you’re serious about filming, this is your lens."

ColoCultureMedia,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2019",If you are making Youtube videos or any videos. Buy this.  There is tons of evidence that this is a great lens on Youtube.  I use this with a 70D to make YT videos and with a Lumix G85.  Yea it is heavy but no matter what you are shooting it is going to be crisp.  The only other lens I use is a 10-18 when needing a super wide angle. This is a bokeh monster.  I've even used it to vlog.  Willzworldmedia on youtube for more visuals in 4k.
GenVicious,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2014","I have used a wide range and variety of lenses. This is by far one of the best and more superior lenses that I have ever used. I used to be a big supporter of 50mm f/1.4 lenses, don't get me wrong I still use my sigma 50mm, but the investment on this lens is worth EVERY penny. I'm big on videography and shoot in a lot of lowlight settings. All I have to say is, if you are big on landscape or even portrait photography, this is the lens to invest on. You won't have to upgrade for a long time. This lens heavily outweighs the use of my 50mm. I've never had a problem with any sigma lenses. I was also thinking of getting the 17-50mm f/2.8, but my room mate has one and this lens I have to say still out shines it's performance. If i could give this lens a 10/5 I would, but 5/5 should do. Hope this review finds yous well."

S. Minor,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2016","This lens is a BEAUTY. Its solid, heavy, and very premium feeling. It pairs nicely with my GH4 when using an adapter. Its VERY sharp, might as well be a prime. I essentially use it as my 24-70 on Micro 4/3. I pair it with a Rokinon 12mm so I have my wide angle covered and this baby tackles the rest. Smooth focus and aperture ring. Since I use a dummy adapter on my GH4, I haven't tested the autofocus yet. I'm very happy with the image quality and color from this lens, I haven't noticed any chromatic aberration either. It's plenty sharp for the GH4 filming in 4K. It's also very fast, which helps small sensors in dark settings. It doesn't work miracles but it holds it's own. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great all-around lens on M43."

I was a little concerned about ordering as there have been reports of focusing issues requiring the Sigma USB dock to calibrate. I decided against the dock figuring I could always add that if necessary. Well, happy to report that this lens focuses perfectly right out of the box. Both One Shot and AI Servo, no issues. Can focus within just a few inches at 35 mm (actually about 56 considering crop factor) and at f1.8, background blur is excellent and very uniform."

I bought the dock and haven't fine-tuned anything yet and am not sure if I'll need to - I have no complaints. I bought this lens for video after seeing some excellent cinematic-quality footage and I was able to recreate that look within hours. Unbelievable quality. Save yourself some money - this lens is at least 3 primes in one. Amazing in low light too."

Having f1.8 all the way through is fantastic."
TRJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2019","The actual barrel that the mount base (stainless steel) mounts to is an engineering plastic. So even though it feels and looks all-metal, it's not. And an important piece is breakable plastic inside. The lens will separate from the mount if any hit is taken by the lens and that in-turn tears the flex cables, making a repair an expensive proposition. All in all though, it goes head to head with L-glass for sharpness, bokeh and light gathering. Wish it were a bit more of a range as 18-35 is pretty damn limiting at times."

One thing I've found I really miss from this lens is image stabilization. The auto focus is also rather poor for video, though I mostly use manual for video anyways. You can hear the clicking in your recording and it spends much time searching. Image stabilization and video auto focus aside though, excellent lens."

This lens was selected for its DXO Mark ratings and specs for the intended application.  Again quality is there completely.  This is my 2nd lens along with the 50 - 150 f 2.8 to run on the DX7100 so I am spoiled with top choice things at this point.  As a nonprofessional I expect to learn and do a lot with this package this summer.  I have read the good write ups and great owner comments before selecting and I think those reports are spot on no issues.  5-14-14 after doing Mother's day at Cleveland Botanical Gardens and all the flowers and staging, got great results with the lens.  Was quick to focus as I was handheld walk about, many people so it was a quick shoot thing and got the shots."

At first it miss 70% of my shot. Please adjust the Lens Micro Adjustment on the body. Be mindful that this lens don't have vibration control so keep the shutter speed @1/200 or above on hand held or as steady as you can. I'm using a 70D body and most of the shot was on point after the lens micro adjustment on the body. I had no auto focus problem after the adjustment. Work like a charm! Yes the lens is very heavy but most lens at this level are. Just like the weight of canon L series. For the quality build and image sharpness, this lens makes up for it. Having 18-35mm wide is very useful. Specially shooting a big group of people."

It is just such a great zoom range for most things, and especially for video production. This thing is amazing on a steadicam/glidecam. The balance barely gets thrown off when zooming and is easy to correct. The ability to open to 1.8 is such an amazing help. While filming a wedding I was so glad to have this fast of a lens and for such a great price."

I purchased it to use on my Sigma SD Quattro H camera, and it has wonderful image quality, which is important since the the SD H had 50 MP effective resolution. It also covers the H sensor without trouble, even though it is DC lens. Have not noticed any vignetting at any aperture. This is a heavy lens, so realize that making a zoom that has a 1.8 constant aperture is no ""small"" feat. I worried about whether it would be worth the cost, but it is worth every penny I paid. Excellent build quality, feel absolutely solid, and operate very smoothly. Yo won't be disappointed."

Condensation is a given in this situation but never had it form inside the lens, after 15-20 minutes was still inside lens. After 1/2 hr indoors it cleared.

Do note that you want to do a focusing test and adjustment because I heard that these lens may need them, so if you get it and it is front/rear focusing do the adjustments or send it in with your camera body to get adjusted. Once it is adjusted for your camera you will be amazed how the pictures look."

The extra opening (f 1.8) for low light work are just enough so I can now capture a concert, or people at a dance, without needing a flash or having blur.  Clear lens too, and nice bokeh (background blur) when shooting something like a flower.  Only drawback is it sometimes takes too long to ""hunt"" on autofocus -- not always -- otherwise, it's wonderful, and it's a gift to have a lens that stops down to 1.8 that's a zoom, even though it only goes to 35mm.  With my APS-C crop-factor the 35 is the equivalent of about 52 mm.  I'm so pleased."

Actually my kit lens is sharper. Don't know if the lens is defective or if it needs calibrating. Maybe the the lens would be great if I wanted to spend a half-day calibrating it with the Sigma dock but that's not going to happen. The lens should be dead-nuts accurate/sharp out of the box.  I simply don't have the luxury of spending that kind of time calibrating something that should have been done by the manufacturer.

The close focus (especially zoomed to 35mm), the unique look of 18mm at f/1.8, the wonderfully solid build and well dampened zoom and focus rings, incredible sharpness, beautiful out of focus areas (bokeh)... I can keep going!"
Jaime E. Ortiz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2020","Initially, I tested this lens with my Canon EOS SL2 and worked great! I still need testing it with other cameras, like the Canon M50 and the Sony A7III with Sigma MC-11 adapter, so I will update, but I love it! Very nice pictures out of it!"
c3h8,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2020","Very nice images along the entire range. F/1.8 is very shallow, I typically stop to F/2.8, but no issues anywhere along the spectrum."

I have been wanting to get away from the standard low end kit lenses ever since I started photography about 15 years ago, now all I want to do is throw those old lenses away after getting my hands on this. The focus is lightning fast, the auto focus when shooting video is flawless and nobody is going to say anything bad about the f/1.8 at EVERY focal length. I'm taking pictures now that would have been impossible for me before."

Dominick,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2020","This lens is the ultimate for low light shooting and bokeh. I use it with my Nikon D5600 and while it’s a great lens, it does struggle a bit with auto focus."
Duy Tran,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2019","Purchased this to fit on my Canon EOS m50 with a Canon EF - EF-M lens adapter. Produces pretty sharp images around f/2, unfortunately the autofocusing on this lens makes a little noise and the in body microphone in the Canon EOS m50 would pick up the sound. But other than that, perfect portrait lens."
wile-e-coyote,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2016","Buying used is a great way to save some money and in this case I didn't sacrifice a shred of quality. This is the lens that is on my camera the most. It's super sharp and I love the fact that I get a very shallow depth of field (f1.8) in a zoom.  This is much better than the nifty 50 for apsc cameras. The only downside,  if you consider it one is the lens has some heft to it, but it's also a mark of the quality that went into it."
Steve B,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2014",I cannot say enough good about this lens. Check out the glowing online reviews and you'll get an idea of how well Sigma hit the mark with this lens. The focus is fast and accurate. It does not come with vibration reduction but a lens this wide doesn't need it.

A. Woodard,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2013","I was lucky enough to purchase this lens during the first batch of shipments. I immediately put it to use for both still and video use with Canon EOS cameras. I honestly could not be more impressed with a lens. It does everything well, including fast accurate focusing, smooth manual focus and zoom.  The build quality is outstanding. Even higher than most L series that I own, and very close to the Zeiss ZE line. It has a pleasing bokeh, and minimal vignetting at all focal lengths. During my last four wedding shoots, it is the only lens I have used during the entire reception.  Please Note: this lens is designed for APS-C, or cropped sensor camera bodies."

A. Tolman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2018","This is a large, serious piece of glass.  It takes sharp, colorful pictures and, in all the venues I've used it, focuses briskly and reliably.  There are times when I wish for a bit more zoom range, but the speed of the lens and the quality of the pictures means that they're croppable without loss of quality.  Works very well on my D7100."

John Lehmann,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2019","I was looking at buying several prime lenses and started reviewing this as an option. I am super happy I did. The lens is super fast, has better color capture and a great improvement over the kit lens. The only thing is that it is heavy. But that being said you can definitely tell it is well made."
Edgar Campos,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2019","Not the best for portrait photography, but it's solid for cameras that arent full frame! The autofocus is great! Video wise this is the lens to go. Photos, it could be better."
Elemino,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2016","The YouTube lens, or so it's called. This was exactly the reason I bought it, and it does a great job fulfilling my many needs. For filming and studio work it's an amazing lens. It's also great for photography, but for my needs it's on the heavy side and I always think twice before deciding to tote it somewhere. Still for it's intended purpose, I'd rather have the weight and build quality than the alternative. This is more or less a prime lens with some zoom, and the results are generally amazing."
nathan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2019","This is already my second purchase of this lens my first one fell off the roof of a building while at a photoshoot, this lens for the money feels like a canon L series lens with how sharp it is and that great fixed aperture of f/1.8 really shines at night. Very good lens for video as well"

Raymond Young,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2013","Sigma built this lens like a tank. I was happy how smooth the zoom was. I have other Sigma/Tamron/Tokina lenses where  the zoom sounds so mechanical. Every one of course would have wanted this at 18 to 55, but that's what you get for being the first zoom 1.8 out there. The pictures come out brighter in the dark, compared to the actual scene. But I noticed 1/40 1.8 was a minimum shutter speed I needed for my Canon t4i to focus correctly, otherwise at a slower shutter speed it would not focus right in low light at ISO 1600. Shooting at 1/3 stop over, my girlfriend's pictures turned out bright and complementary, smoothing out her complexion."

I do a lot of portrait work, and I find that this lens doesn't have that much distortion compared to the kit lens that came iwth my camera. I bought it so I can photograph events more easily, and the constant 1.8 aperture is perfect for that. (YES! It is a constant aperture. It can shoot at 18 f1.8 and 35 f1.8)"
tman5890,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2014","This is the best built, best performing, and best looking lens I've ever owned. I saved up months to purchase this item and I'm so glad that I did. The pictures are amazing and the aperture is fantastic for bokeh. The only downsides are the zoom, if it had a larger zoom I'd say this would be the only lens I needed. I have tried it in low lighting, but have not tried it out for stargazing shots. I plan on taking more pictures with this lens soon and I will update my review with what I find. So far I would say this lens is a must buy!"

Eric,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2015","Using this lens for indoor, street, night portrait and day portrait photography is fantastic. You can get a pretty wide panorama at 28mm equiv. if you need it, and 50mm equiv. with incredible brightness and bokeh for portraits. The AF is lightning fast in all but the darkest scenarios and it's nearly silent. The lens is a bit heavy but clearly well built and easy to use, with the focus rings gliding effortlessly. Have used for personal nighttime shoots and professional nighttime and indoor shoots, and the quality is incredible even paired with a simple Canon T3i."

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2016","The constant aperture and the lens' clarity are phenomenal. The only two drawbacks are the focal length and lack of image stabilization, but the lack of these features is well worth the price point — especially if you do a lot of model or concert photography and have steady hands. At f/1.8, image stabilization isn't a problem because it brings in a lot of light; either way, find a way to keep your shutter speed above 1/200 and stability shouldn't be a problem."
Hemifam,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2019","This lens is absolutely amazing and guaranteed to make your photos and videos crispy.

Doscho,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2014","If you are considering this lens, stop. Buy it.

Louis,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2015","Very, very heavy. I wanted to love this lens, but I need to travel a lot and its too heavy and big! Its so well made. The number of reviews that found focusing problems with Pentax was also a key concern. Its an amazing lens if weight is not an issue. The focus issues seem to be software related so may be resolved in a future update."

Wayne B.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2015","Nice lens, though quite heavy, but that is not surprising for a f1.8 zoom lens.

My 50mm 1.4 and 35mm 1.4 shoot flawlessly and i have been looking for something wider below 20mm for my 80D camera. I would love to keep using this lens but that requires purchasing additional equipment and modifying it in a program that i would have no clue how to use.
Denise,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2019","This lens is so so so amazing! It took a little bit to adjust to the zoom being the opposite of traditional Canon lenses, but I still love love it!"
Eduardo P.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2016","Great lens, very sharp, it feels robust and very heavy for a short range zoom. It fits and works excellent with my A58 and it's ok for my A6500."
jones adirimo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2019",Super clear lens. Currently my best lens for run and gun video production. Best all round lens for the gh5
Pat J. Dooley,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2014","People say this is like three primes lenses in one. It is. The f/1.8 is not a gimmick. You can shoot wide open and your images are sharp and free of chromatic distortion. It is a big, heavy lens. But it takes beautiful photographs and lets you blur out backgrounds to perfection. It is also very sharp, much sharper than any kit lens. It has some competition, but it will see a lot of time on my A77ii body."
Top Notch Approved Deals,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2014","I'm using this lens on a Nikon D5100. At first, I  had some focus issues, then I purchase the USB Dock and fine tuned its settings. Its a beautiful experience after. Its sharp or sharper than any prime lens I've ever used, even at 18mm 1.8 & across the entire focal length. The trick is to adjust the settings for your individual camera. For my use, this is now my all round lens."
Higbe33,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2015",I love this lens! Even wide open it is tac sharp. Enter your camera into dxomark and check the recommended lenses. I bet this is one of them.
Adrian costa,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2019","the lens has very good construction quality, the photos are great, the 1.8 blur is fascinating."
Navid,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2016","Probably the best lens you can get for a crop body camera. Much sharper than any kit lens you can get. Definitely worth the purchase for anyone who is looking to drastically improve their picture quality without having to upgrade to a full frame body. However, only works on a crop body camera."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2017","This item was in pristine condition. I absolutely love this lens.

two dachshunds,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2013",Not sharp enough to out- resolve a 24 megapixel sensor but close enough..... Closer than any Nikon lens will take you.
Edgar Cervantes,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2017",Been using this lens for about a year now and it has been great. It did have focusing issues at first but I sent it to Sigma to get the lens calibrated and shot amazing after that.
Luis Giovann Sanchez Rios,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2018","Is very solid, very sharp and very fast autofocus. Is the best lens for crop sensor. I'm a Filmmaker and for me is the best Lens for video."
Doug English,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2016","Despite its size, Sigmas' 18-35mm lens feels well balanced on the camera. It also takes a good quality shot. The lens is somewhat pricey, but the build quality and the sharp images it produces, more than compensates for its cost.  A good lens for serious picture takers."

Fareed Rajack,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2015","BEST LENS I have ever used ! I own a Canon T5i and a 70D . This lens is super fast and sharp . I am amazed at how it performs in low light. I own the 18-135 mm , the 40mm pancake, the 55-250 stm and the Tamron 150-600, and this Sigma is now the Icing on the Cake !"
Jim Smith,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2014","Optically impressive.  But the focus accuracy is hit or miss.  I have to shoot more frames and play with composition to ensure that I get at least one shot that is focused correctly, and then crop it to what the composition should be."
Jason,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2014","This lens takes great photos. I rated it 3 stars because, to me, the 18-35 focal length is completely misleading."
Brian Kelley & Carolyn Taylor,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2013","For those graduating from a kit lens to something slightly better quality, the Sigma 18-35mm F1.8 for Canon is an excellent option. The AF when stopped down is an annoyance, as other reviewers have mentioned, but I've been able to switch to manual or simply AF a few times as a work around. Almost all photos on my site were shot with this lens and a Canon 7D if you need examples: carolynkelleyphotography.com."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2017","I have a Canon EOS 70d, and I bought this lens after reading reviews praising its versatility and quality. I was excited about its wide aperture and zoom capabilities. However, this lens can not focus!! All my photos turn out blurry, and as I have done more research, many people seem to have the same problem. The zoom capabilities are limited which I knew when I bought it (it's still better than nothing). The autofocus will not work with the camera, and the quality of my videos are terrible with this lens. The much cheaper lens that came with the camera is far better in quality than the Sigma. I am very disappointed in this product and would advise caution in your decision to purchase it. I know people have said buying a Sigma mount has improved the focus capabilities, but I am not willing to pay more money for a lens that should work in the first place."
LA DIY,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2017","I use this on my GH4 and get to F1.2 with the lens booster. So far, it's been a pleasure to use this lens. You get a decent shallow depth-of-field for portrait shots while maintaining a wide field of view for general use."
Zack hollander,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2017",Ah freakin mazing as long as you make sure you have a crop sensor. Don't be a fool and buy this for a full frame and complain about the vignetting. Autofocus is just slightly slow but really that's being picky
GMAN,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2013",This is a very nicely built lens.
ALEXEY VOLOVODENKO,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2013","It really delivers the sharpness you can read about in the reviews. Construction is good, feel is nice, controls convenient. May have slight problems focusing in low light but keep in mind it is not a problem of the lens, it is a problem of camera focusing in such condition where focusing is problematic but shooting is still possible."
GN Support,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2016","Amazing in low light. If you undstand how to use ISO, F-Stop, and shutter speed you can get extremely good pictures and video. I use a Canon T3i and auto focus is pretty slow with it but I believe that is just because the camera quality isn't the best."
Mikkel Stephensen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2014","I have nothing bad to say about this lens. It is outstanding. The bokeh is really nice. It's fast and stealth. The image quality is supreme. I own several L-lenses, and I honestly feel like the built quality is even better on the Sigma."
Fritzroy Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2018",Sigma has outdone themselves with this lens. Much better and clearer than the Panasonic native lense. Do not hesitate to buy if you are thinking about this lens​

Dean Can,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2016","OMG, so sharp, I absolutely love the colors and resolution of this lens.  It's APSC only (unless you're out at 35mm) regardless, if there is one lens for everyday shooting on any APSC camera this fits the bill.  One thing though, this puppy is heavy!"
Patrick Brown,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2018",It’s heavy. But the image quality is unbelievable. I’m by no means professional-just an amateur photographer. But my family pictures etc have just been amazing. Wide field of view.

The lens itself is great glass and great quality the auto focus is so bad ... you have  to buy  the docking station update if available. Mine is already up to date I have to program and change the auto focus at every focal length.  NOT EASY. Lens made me want to pull my kit lens  out of the closet.

The honorable,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2016","Amazing lens.  Top image quality, versatile wide aperture, and robust construction.  A bit heavy and bulky, but not a big deal considering the  results.  Much cheaper than any red stripe Canon lens, and probably even better quality."

Paul C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2014","Shooting at f1.8 allows for the photographic artist to use amazingly small depth of fields. Beautiful sharp results. Way heavy which speaks to the quality of the tube and amount of glass contained inside. The only thing I don't like is that the focus and zoom rings are in the ""wrong"" place for the lens I'm used to over the years."

James Klein,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2022","I have used Canon Pro Lenses (EF-L Series) for many years. They have been with me around the world and up and down the block. When I purchased this lens, I felt like it couldn't possibly compete with Canon or Nikon pro lenses. I was amazed at the clarity and sharpness of this lens right out of the box! When used in video applications, the crisp sharp undistorted lens looks tack sharp and renders color well, without too much vignetting or chromatic aberration. The best part of the lens is the range of 18-35 which gives you a workable focal length for interviews and close-up work without distortion, also at 1.4f it is plenty bright for low light and dark scenes. On a BMPCC 6k it performs brilliantly. I own two! Have put my Canon glass on my Canon Camera where it belongs, but this Sigma Lens is amazing on Blackmagic cameras."

tim velo,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2018","Would work great for a crop frame sensor, but on a full frame, most of the focal length shows the outer lens mechanism. Not just a little vignette, but full corners clipped by the frame from 18 - 28 mm. Not sure why I would want to buy a lens that would be worth more than the crop frame camera it would work on. Stick with canon glass if you have anything above a 6D! I'm ashamed that they would even try to sell this as a professional lens."

Image clarity is fantastic, autofocus is fast and silent and IS is great too. Perfect for portraits and for astrophotography, kind of a do it all lens.

GT,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2016","I bought this lens Nov 2014. I am a very active event/party photographer and have taken 40,000+ shots with this lens. It is my pride and joy and just about never comes off of my Canon 70! Before purchasing this, my main lens was Sigma's 17-50 f/2.8, which I really LOVED because it took awesome pictures, had great autofocus even in low light, and the 17-50 range made it very versatile for nice short range shots! However, turns out I didn't know what love was until I bought my Sigma 18-35! I was a little hesitant to buy it at first since I already had a lens that covered short range shots, but the thought of possibly having the equivalent of 3 1.8 prime lenses in one made it very tempting. I was/am always looking for ways to improve my work, so I took the dive and it was one of the best investments I've ever made! Now, my old love (the Sigma 17-50 2.8) is used as a backup and never sees any action."

Gatorowl,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2013","This is one of the sharpest lenses I have ever used.  It's pointless to compare it with other zoom lenses.  Rather, it competes with the better prime lenses.  However, it is not perfect."
Ben Jackson,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2020","I know, why would it be for the price. But this lens gets recommended a lot for video work, and nobody seems to ever talk about this fact. I have a Blackmagic 6K and used to have a RED Epic. Did I expect it to be parfocal? I dunno, I suppose I did, as I previously had the Canon 24-105 and that was. But what's really infuriating to me is that nobody seems to mention it. If I'd just been told before I bought it (like I'm telling you) I would have really appreciated it, and known what I was getting into with this cheap (but otherwise still great) lens. Without parfocal, I'm constantly changing zoom and having to refocus every time. Not just in the middle of shots, which is basically impossible: I try to do an artistic zoom in/out for a comedy moment or something, and then it's REALLY blurry and I end up messing up the shot and have to try it like 10 times, which annoys the actors. But I'm also talking about between shots, to do a reframe to get a mid or CU etc. Especially completely open, the focus is very specific, and so when I change focal length then I have to get focus again and the actor has to be in place to check focus etc etc. It makes me look unprofessional, basically. It's just something that I feel people should know as every time I read a website recommending lenses for the BM6K nobody EVER warns that it's not parfocal, they just make out it's this super lens that has no downside. I'm considering just ditching it and adding to my Rokinon cine prime collection, with a 16mm that'll actually get me a bit wider (I already have a 35mm, 85 and 135, all of which are just not wide enough for the sensor on the blackmagic for anything but mid/CU which has lead me to stop using them at all). Yes it takes longer to switch a lens than it does to change zoom and focus even when dealing with the sigma not being non-parfocal, and I'd still have all the issues I mentioned with making actors stand in for focus because now I have a whole new lens, but for me, it's just very frustrating to think you can rely on a single lens for most shots, especially given everyone recommends it, when you really can't. Changing lenses at least is understood on set, and seems professional. It's NOT professional to not be able to rely on your gear to get the shot you need, and have to ask for another shot because you messed it up. I dunno, obviously with prime lenses I can't even do zoom in/outs during shots, so I'd be stuck anyway. But at least prime lenses will give me more flexibility and the 35 and 85mm are even faster. Of course, the other solution that's probably ideal for my situation would be the $4k version of this, the cine one that apparaently IS parfocal (i haven't confirmed this though). So that's probably what I need to get when I have the money. If you have the money, don't waste it on this - I wish I hadn't - just put it towards the more expensive Sigma cine lens with the same 18-35mm and T2 (which I think is the same as F1.8) which also have nice gears etc, or a set of cine primes if you don't need the zoom function and have time to change out lenses. Or do get this one, but knowing it's not parfocal up front, so you're not disappointed. As for photography work which this lens is more intended for, it's probably perfect and not being parfocal doesn't really matter!"
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2018","I bought this lens from a vendor not on amazon but I’m very happy with this lens! It is incredibly sharp and probably one of the sharpest lenses for and APS-C camera at the moment. With it being at 18-35mm, it doesn’t have much range but it is great from landscape photography, and I use it as an unconventional portrait lens at 35mm. If you are worried about bokeh, it is just buttery smooth. You may have to buy the sigma dock to do some focus adjustments as I found my copy to front focus a lot at first. Once you get the adjustments in, it is just amazing. Shooting into direct sun it doesn’t have too much chromatic abberation and only some glaring but it’s not too bad. This lens does really well in low light as well. It is definitely a more expensive lens for APS-C cameras but I say after lens adjustments it is a highly capable lens. I didn’t give 5 stars because of the slight focusing issue but other than that I would say it’s worth the buy!"

Brian,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2015",I have it mounted on a Canon 7D2 and the image quality I am getting is incredible. When shooting wide open at F1.8 I find I must set to a single focus point and aim that at an area of high contrast (like an eye) if you let the camera pick its own area there is a good chance that things will appear out of focus.

I am using this on a 7d Mark II and my only complaint is the focus does hunt just a little longer than I would like but it's still pretty darn quick.  Considering it's meant to be a superb portrait piece of glass - the little slower focus isn't a deal breaker.  Bokeh is solid and the DOF at 1.8 is beautiful.  Rent it first of course - but you'll love it.

The images just didn't pop like we expected them to.  After learning a little bit about photography (aperture priority mode is your friend!) we decided to bite the bullet and get a good lens and let me tell you the difference between this lens and the kit lens is night and day.  The colors are vivid and the images pop straight out of the camera."
Tyson Hunsaker,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2020","Sigma Art 18-35mm is legendary for a reason. This lens is shockingly sharp and fast throughout the aperture and zoom range. It's beautifully renders the image and the craftsmanship and build quality is stellar. Sigma takes care of their art lenses and its obvious their more affordable lenses in the Art series lives up to the name of Sigma. This lens doesn't however have image stabilization so be aware of this. It's also very sharp and ""clinical"" as some have called it which means it doesn't have much ""character"" so be aware. I personally love that in a lens so it's perfect for me."
S. Peter Lewis,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2018","I've been a pro shooter for over 30 years and use primes almost exclusively. This lens equals or beats my primes in the same focal-length range. And with a 1.8 max aperture, it truly gives full frame bokeh on APS-C cameras. It's built like a tank, has very smooth zoom and focusing rings, and there is essentially no chromatic aberation, even wide open. Yes, the auto-focus can be spotty, but don't let that deter you: it's quite easy to fix with your camera's micro adjustments, and in live view and manual it's perfect anyway. This is just about the finest APS-C lens I have ever used. Sigma hit this one completely out of the park!"
Chris Basden,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2020","I'm primarily a video shooter. The value in this lens is simply unparalleled! It's been said in every product review out there, but there's just not another option if you need a fast, wide zoom lens for crop-body cameras. I'm using with an 80D, but I'll have this lens long after that camera's dead and gone. I plan to upgrade to an EOS R (Full frame, but you can use this lens with that body in crop mode) eventually, but as ""outdated"" as my 80D is, I'm getting great results using this lens.

thatmanphil,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2017","The first thing you'll notice about this lens is that it's big and heavy.  People say it's like owning three fast primes in one; i say it's also like carrying three fast primes in once.  Attached to my 80d I find myself holding the kit buy the lens instead of the body. But it's well worth the fast aperture and image quality.  Even shot wide open at f1.8 pictures are very sharp and predictable.  Don't let the limited zoom range put you off, 18-35 is extremely useful and is perfect for street photography, travel, events, and portraits. With this lens you really can  get a pro level look to your images. The full time manual focus is the icing on the cake here, and i find myself preferring to focus manually at times."
Brittany U,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2016","I just cannot say enough positive things about this lens. This was probably the most expensive lens I've ever bought, I try to buy used and otherwise hunt for deals on lenses that are ~300 or less, so needless to say I was a little hesitant to drop $800, but man was it worth it. This lens performs as if it were three times the price at least. I've always been a fan of wide-angle images, and on my 35mm camera I loved the way my 28mm 2.8 created the perfect mixture of depth but gave that ""context"" of a wide angle, something you lose with telephoto lenses. This lens is sharp, collects amazing light, has beautiful color, has a great build quality... I can't say enough things. My favorite lens."
alexw,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2017","I cannot recommend this lens enough. I would probably buy it at $1000, it's that good.

Having the ability to take a picture of an entire house from the sidewalk on the same side of a street, or an entire side of a car that is only 10 or so feet away is awesome. The little bit of zoom to 35mm (56mm equivalent on my canon t4i) is a great normal eye-width view. I've only had for a few weeks, but it rarely leaves my camera."

I use this with my D7200 and it's an excellent pair for taking photos of events, landscapes, etc. It's not much of a portrait lens due to it's short focal length; ie does not flatter appearances as subjects appear slightly wider than they actually are. However, for my needs, it's perfect! I bought this off Adorama and for the same price on Amazon; I received a sigma docking station for free. Fortunately for me, my lens did not need to be configured as the front and back focusing were good. The free sigma docking station is very useful however for future sigma lenses, and I do intend on purchasing more from this brand considering how well they've made the Sigma 18 35 1.8."

David Wang,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2014","This lens is amazing, the quality you get for your money is unbelievable. For about 900$ you get to basically cram the Canon 20mm, 24mm, 28mm, and 35mm prime lenses into one convenient body (which would all together cost about 5000$). This lens is Canon L lens level image quality, often even surpassing the Canon lenses in terms of chromatic aberration, vignetting, color and sharpness. The bokeh is creamy and beautiful, and the f/1.8 capability adds great low-light versatility. The focusing is also fast and quiet, and you can tweak it with the Sigma USB dock if you so desire. Furthermore, the build quality is amazing and you can expect it to last you for a long time. The only downside I would say is the weight, it's quite hefty but what do you expect for zoom lens with a wide aperture."

I use a 7D and the lens is not treated well by me as I walk around it still looks like the day I bought it.  This is my first Sigma lens but it won't be my last based on this model.  Only con I can think of is that it is very heavy and it does not focus lightning fast  when moving but is very quick on fixed objects.  Highly recommend to anyone shooting with a APS-C sensor."

Chad Tomas,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2021","Ok, I regret not buying this lens for my BMPCC6k pro. I mean my 24mm Rokinon is great too for a fast cinema lens, but the purple fringing has been annoying sometimes during very bright situations. I love the focal range and the aperture is very wide and fast. I can see why many pros and cinematographers use this lens as their work horse and again, I kind of regret not buying it. But oh well, we'll see. This lens really is...all you need."
René Martínez,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2022","Its the most bright an accuracy lenses, I never had, beautiful, pristine build, Im fully recomend"
Dan DeMars,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2021",I'm using this on a Panasonic gh4 and gh5 no speedbooster so I have to keep it wide open at f1.8 and WOW this footage looks amazing. Makes my gh4 poor low light digital grain more manageable now. I see why people recommend this and the price is great. Like almost 1/3 the price of a full frame lens.
